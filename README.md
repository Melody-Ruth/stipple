# stipple

##### Project Description:
Generates a "stippled" version of a photo. The image is represented with randomly placed black pixels on a white background, with the black pixels more likely to be placed in darker areas of the original photo. The effect is modeled on the "stippling" art technique.

##### File structure:
index.htm is the main html file. stipple.js is the main javascript file. Outdated versions of either are in the old folder. The graphics folder contains all of the images needed for the game.
